# Time-loop-Puzzle-game
A Time Loop Puzzle Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where players solve challenges within a repeating time cycle. Each loop reveals new clues while past actions affect the future. Features interactive UI, logic-based puzzles, dynamic states, and immersive design.


Time Loop Puzzle Game is an interactive frontend-based puzzle experience built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game places players inside a repeating time cycle where they must solve logical challenges before the loop resets. Every action taken in one loop influences the next, creating layered problem-solving mechanics and strategic thinking. Players uncover hidden clues, unlock new paths, and manipulate objects differently across timelines to progress.

The game features a dynamic state management system, interactive UI elements, smooth animations, and responsive design for an immersive experience. JavaScript controls game logic, event handling, and time-reset mechanics, while CSS enhances visual storytelling with transitions and effects. The objective is to break the time loop by making the correct sequence of decisions. This project demonstrates strong frontend skills, logical structuring, DOM manipulation, and creative game design.
